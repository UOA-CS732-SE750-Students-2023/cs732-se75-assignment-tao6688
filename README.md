# COMPSCI 732 Tech demo

 I'll create a new React, using Vite. Run the following command:

```sh
npm create vite@latest
```

Then, select the following options:
- Project name: test-demo
- Framework: React
- Variant: JavaScript + SWC



After open it with VSCode, install dependencies and start the dev environment:

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

This should start the dev environment running. The URL for the app will be shown in the terminal window (e.g. <http://127.0.0.1:5173/). 

The echarts and echarts-for-react are necessary.
```sh
npm install echarts --save
npm install echarts-for-react --save
```


When I set up the drop down list, I use the antd dependency. 
```sh
npm add antd
```
